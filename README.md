## About ##

An implementation of the CoDeepNEAT algorithm developed by Risto Miikkulainen. It extends the NEAT algorithm to develop deep neural networks by coevolving a population of blueprints along with a population of modules. This approach is intended to copy the modularity observed in other successful networks.

To test the viability of this implementation, I will target the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification data sets.
