## About ##

An implementation of the CoDeepNEAT algorithm developed by Risto Miikkulainen and others at University Texas at Austin. It extends the NEAT algorithm to develop deep neural networks by coevolving a population of blueprints along with a population of modules. This approach is intended to copy the modularity observed in other successful networks.

To test the viability of this implementation, I will target the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification data sets.

## Previous Versions ##

The original repo this project is based on is at: [neat-python]https://github.com/neat-python/neat-python. It implements NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) which is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural networks. This project is a Python 2.7 implementation of NEAT. For further information regarding general concepts and theory, please see [Selected Publications](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications) on Stanley's website.
